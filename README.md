# deep-learning
This folder contain latex note and exercise on book `Deep Learning` by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. And `Dive into deep learning` by Aston Zhang, Mu Li, Zachary C. Lipton, Alexander J. Smola

## Usage
Due to the limite of computation ability, most python programs are implemented in the other directory: (namely `machine-learning`) in `torch` framwork. All python file containing the word `example` are DIRECT COPY of code from the book for learning propose. 

The `deep-learning笔记.pdf` and `mxnet-note.pdf`file, in contrast, contain more complete description of neural networks and tensor calculations. Notes taken in `machine-learning` directory are only supplementary note based on these notes.

## file structure
    /deep_learning
    | 
    |__deep-learning_note      (contains pdf note on the two referenced books, and its latex source code)
    | 
    |__mxnet_note              (contains pdf note on MXNET framework, and latex source code)
    |
    |__(all other directories) (contain python code, some direct copy of code from the books, to experiment with performance)
